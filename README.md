# PersonalityPulse: Predicting Introvert vs. Extrovert Using Deep Learning

This project uses a deep learning model in PyTorch to predict whether a person is an introvert or an extrovert based on their personality traits. The model is trained on the [Personality Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shalmamuji/personality-prediction-data-introvert-extrovert) from Kaggle.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Trained on real psychometric data
- Deep Neural Network built with PyTorch
- Streamlit dashboard for real-time predictions
- High test accuracy (~99%)
- Feature importance analysis using permutation method

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
This Kaggle dataset includes personality factors like:
- Openness
- Conscientiousness
- Extroversion
- Agreeableness
- Neuroticism
- Self-esteem
- Social support
